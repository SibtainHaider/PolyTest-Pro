Description of this Project:
The poject contains feature files, step definitions and data file.
This project focuses on testing Web Applications, Android Applications, API's, Databases using BDD approach.
There are common steps that are reused in each feature file and there is no need of redefining the steps such as click, enter_data, etc.
The BDD approach helps the developers, QA automators and the clients to be on the same page.
Tests are run that fetch specific feature file and run the steps in the correct order.
The step definition then fetches the locators and the test data from the dedicated files and then perform the actions.
